# ServiceNow Widget-Simple-List Misconfiguration Scanner

## Overview
This tool scans for misconfigurations in the **ServiceNow** **widget-simple-list** plugin. It checks whether the target instance is vulnerable to data exposure risks due to misconfigured settings.

## Important Note
For an in-depth understanding of the attack technique and exploitation, consult the [technical details available here](https://www.enumerated.ie/servicenow-data-exposure).

## Pre-requisites
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries: `requests`

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install requests
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `servicescan.py`.
3. Choose one of the following methods to run the script using Python 3:

### Method 1: Single URL
```bash
python3 servicescan.py --url https://redacted.service-now.com
```

### Method 2: Multiple URLs from a File
```bash
python3 servicescan.py --file urls.txt
```

### Fast-Check Option
Perform a fast check that only scans for the table `kb_knowledge` using the `--fast-check` argument:
```bash
python3 servicescan.py --url https://redacted.service-now.com --fast-check
```

### Extended tests
To perform more tests than what is provided by default, you can specify a `--table-file TABLE_FILE` argument to query particular tables a fields. A sample file is provided in `sample_table_query.txt`:
```bash
python3 servicescan.py --url https://redacted.service-now.com --table-file sample_table_query.txt
```

### Using a Proxy
To use a proxy server, use the `--proxy` option:
```bash
python3 servicescan.py --url https://redacted.service-now.com --proxy http://host:port
```

### Credentials
By default, the script will perform a scan without logging-in. If interested in performing a scan using a particular user
```bash
python3 servicescan.py --url https://redacted.service-now.com --user test.snc.internal
```
You will be prompted to specify a password if not provided via the `--password` argument.

### Example Output
If the target instance is found to be vulnerable, you'll receive an output similar to the following:
```bash
https://redacted.service-now.com/api/now/sp/widget/widget-simple-list?t=incident is EXPOSED, found at least 167 items
https://redacted.service-now.com/api/now/sp/widget/widget-simple-list?t=oauth_entity is EXPOSED, found at least 3 items
Headers to forge requests:
X-UserToken: 76a458ffdbf5[REDACTED]0c02ba13393b764
Cookie: JSESSIONID=7EB7[REDACTED]B5D07E; glide_user_route=glide.4884750d[REDACTED]ca0436e4; glide_node_id_for_js=3143935013eaa5a1e[REDACTED]8a698b419c40837dfce63002d5;
```

> **Note:** A table may be public but not necessarily expose sensitive information. Always verify that the disclosed data is indeed confidential before taking any action.
